# DigitalClock
Beginner project: GUI clock made with Tkinter

This clock is a beginner project I embarked on to productively expand my knowledge of the Python programming language.
Some help was gotten from tutorials, but overall, this is an original work.

Feel free to contribute and share ideas as well.
